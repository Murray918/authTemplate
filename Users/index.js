//TODO in this file we want to basically be able to switch the database based on a variable in the .env file. This variable is must be called DATABASE_TYPE. Ideally we would just export this file into the app.js and that is how you would set up the database. We will see how that goes. I am keeping this in Users for now however some of the logic might make sense to move into the config.
